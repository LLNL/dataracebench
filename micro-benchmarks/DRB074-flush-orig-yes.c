This benchmark is extracted from flush_nolist.1c of OpenMP Application
Programming Interface Examples Version 4.5.0 .
We added one critical section to make it a test with only one pair of data races.
The data race will not generate wrong result though. So the assertion always passes.
Data race pair:  i@70:10 vs. i@71:11
